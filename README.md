# -Bangla-Handwritten-Text-Conversion-Using-Optical-Character-Recognition-

✍️ Digitizing Bangla Handwritten Text with AI & OCR

Developed a Bangla Handwritten Text Conversion System that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to accurately convert Bangla handwriting into digital text, combined with Explainable AI (XAI) to interpret model decisions. This system provides high accuracy and transparency for handwritten Bangla text recognition, enhancing accessibility and automation in digital transcription.

Project Overview:
Handwritten text recognition for Bangla is challenging due to its complex script and varying handwriting styles. This project utilizes OCR to process handwritten Bangla text, followed by Explainable AI to interpret the system's predictions and highlight key features that influence the results.

Key Features:
✔️ OCR-Based Text Recognition – Accurate recognition of handwritten Bangla characters
✔️ Explainable AI – Using XAI to make predictions interpretable and transparent
✔️ Deep Learning Models – Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for high performance
✔️ Data Preprocessing – Image binarization, noise removal, and normalization
✔️ Model Evaluation – Analyzing accuracy and interpreting model behavior with LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)

Tech Stack:
🔹 Python – TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Pandas, Matplotlib
🔹 Machine Learning – Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
🔹 Explainable AI – LIME, SHAP for model interpretation
🔹 Dataset – Bangla handwritten text dataset

Future Enhancements:
🔹 Improving Accuracy – Training with more diverse handwriting datasets
🔹 Mobile Application – Implementing the model in a mobile app for on-the-go text recognition
🔹 Multilingual Support – Extending to other languages and scripts for broader applications

This project brings AI and OCR technology together to convert handwritten Bangla text into a digital format, improving efficiency and accessibility while ensuring model transparency through Explainable AI.
